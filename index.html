            I was confused on<br>

            <p>you were not ready<br>
                But <span>they issued</span> the shovel <span>and the rifle and you dug</span><br>
                But <span>to watch</span> you <span>sitting there between the sandbags</span><br>
                But <span>to watch</span> the sand <span>spilling out the bullet holes</span><br>
                But what <span>did they expect</span><br>
                But what <span>did they really think a sheet of metal could prevent</span><br>
                But I sat <span>rolling little ears of pasta off my thumb like helmets</span><br>
                But <span>it was not a table of</span> fallen men<br>
                But my hand <span>registered fatigue</span><br>
                But the men <span>in fatigues were tired of sleeping in shifts</span><br>
                But you <span>snuck into town and dialed home </span>until you wrote your fingers<br>
                       were tired<br>
                But the code <span>for Shiraz was down</span><br>
                But all of Shiraz was down<br>
                But <span>the sheet lightning above</span> the Ferris wheel of rusted bolts<br>
                But I am sure they are alright <span>you wrote Well to reassure yourself</span><br>
                But the wind <span>like an old mouth shaking the unnamed evergreen outside<br>
                       my window</span><br>
                But what I mean is I'd like very much to talk a bit<br>
